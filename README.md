# MultiPDFmin
This is an open source desktop web application for editing PDF files on Windows, macOS and Linux. It was developed using Firefox browser and can be used in Opera, Chrome and Edge browers, as well. However, the styles of the sliders, scrollbars and selection menus varies in different browsers. Running MultiPDFmin in Safari browser is not supported. Likewise accessing the web app on a tablet lacks operations. 
You can also use MultiPDFmin offline. Just clone the repo and open the index.html file in Firefox. The web app ships a PDF reader, merger, splitter, creator and editor of text, drawings, geometry and images.
