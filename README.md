# MultiPDFmin
This is an open source desktop web application for editing PDF files. It was developed using Firefox browser and runs ideally in that browser. Running MultiPDFmin in other browsers than Firefox results in different appearance and functionality. Likewise accessing the web app on a tablet lacks operations. 
You can also use MultiPDFmin offline. Just clone the repo and open the index.html file in Firefox. The web app has a PDF reader, merger, splitter, creator and editor of text, drawings, geometry and images.
